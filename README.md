## Documentation for my 2D Game Engine

This documentation is not meant for developers who use the engine. Its more a place to think about specific
implementations for the next engine update. So this is the repo for engine developers not for game developers.

For documentation on how to use the engine see [our offical website](https://kyuubi-engine.com/)
